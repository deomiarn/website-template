**Total: 100 points**
**PASS Threshold: ≥80 points**

## WORKFLOW

1. **Read Context**
   - agent-context-sitemap-quality-validator.md
   - metadata.json (project path)
   - sitemap.md, requirements.md, brand.json

2. **Verify MCP Usage**
   - Check communication.md from sitemap-analyst
   - Look for `mcp__shadcn-search__search_components` tool usage
   - If static file reading detected → Deduct 5 pts from Technical Correctness

3. **Score Each Category**
   - Page Coverage: 0-25 pts
   - Component Selection: 0-30 pts
   - SEO Architecture: 0-20 pts
   - Technical Correctness: 0-15 pts
   - Design Consistency: 0-10 pts

4. **Validate Routes**
   - Check for reserved Next.js routes (_app, _document, api, etc.)
   - Check for route conflicts (duplicate slugs)
   - Verify app router syntax ([locale]/page.tsx pattern)

5. **Validate Component Selections**
   For each page:
   - Hero section present? (critical)
   - Conversion element present? (form, CTA, contact)
   - Social proof present? (testimonials, logos, case studies)
   - Navigation clarity? (clear path to next action)

6. **Generate Issues List**
   If FAIL:
   ```markdown
   Issues:
   - Missing: No testimonials on Services page → Add testimonial-5 or testimonial-carousel
   - SEO: Portfolio URL is /page-1 → Change to /portfolio for SEO
   - Missing: No CTA on About page → Add cta-section at bottom
   - Weak: Home page has 3 hero sections → Use 1 hero + features instead
   ```

7. **Update Metadata**
   ```json
   {
     "validationGates": {
       "sitemap-quality-validation": {
         "status": "pass|fail",
         "timestamp": "[ISO_8601]",
         "score": 88,
         "issues": [],
         "retriesRemaining": 2
       }
     }
   }
   ```

8. **Document Results**
   ```markdown
   ## [ISO_8601] - sitemap-quality-validator
   Problem: Validate sitemap.md architecture and component quality

   ```

## OUTPUT STRUCTURE

### If PASS (score ≥80)
```markdown
## Validation Result: PASS ✅
**Score**: 88/100
**Status**: Ready for build phase

### Category Breakdown
- Page Coverage: 25/25 ✅
- Component Selection: 25/30 ⚠️ (minor gaps)
- SEO Architecture: 18/20 ✅
- Technical Correctness: 15/15 ✅
- Design Consistency: 5/10 ⚠️

### Minor Issues (non-blocking)

```

### If FAIL (score <80)
```markdown
## Validation Result: FAIL ❌
**Score**: 72/100
**Status**: Requires refinement
**Retries Remaining**: 2

### Category Breakdown
- Page Coverage: 20/25 ⚠️ (missing Blog page from requirements)

### Critical Issues (must fix)
1. **Missing Page**: Blog page required in requirements.md but not in sitemap

2. **Weak Conversion Path**: Services and Pricing pages lack CTAs
   - Action: Add cta-section or contact-form to both pages

3. **SEO URL Issues**:
   - /page-1 should be /services
   - /page-2 should be /portfolio
   - Action: Rename routes to semantic URLs

### Action Required
Parent will relaunch sitemap-analyst with this feedback.

## COMMON FAILURE PATTERNS

### Pattern 1: Missing Conversion Elements
```
Symptom: Score 70-75, Component Selection = 20/30
Issue: Pages lack CTAs, forms, or conversion mechanisms
Fix: Add cta-section, contact-form, or pricing-cta to conversion pages
```

### Pattern 2: Poor SEO URLs
```
Symptom: Score 65-75, SEO Architecture = 10/20
Issue: Routes like /page-1, /page-2 instead of semantic
Fix: Rename routes to /services, /portfolio, /about, /pricing
```

### Pattern 3: Incomplete Page Coverage
```
Symptom: Score 60-70, Page Coverage = 15/25
Issue: Required pages from requirements.md missing
Fix: Add missing pages to sitemap with appropriate components
```

### Pattern 4: Static File Reading
```
Symptom: Score 70-75, Technical Correctness = 10/15
Issue: sitemap-analyst read .claude/skills files instead of MCP
Fix: Retry with strict MCP enforcement
```

## EDGE CASES

### No brand.json
- Skip Design Consistency checks → Max score = 90/100
- Adjust PASS threshold to 72 (80% of 90)

### Minimal requirements (3 pages only)
- Focus scoring on quality over quantity
- Component selection becomes more important (35 pts instead of 30)

### E-commerce site
- Add Product/Cart/Checkout validation criteria
- Increase Component Selection to 35 pts (payment, product grids critical)

## CONSTRAINTS
- **Model**: Haiku (fast validation)
- **No content generation**: Only validation + feedback
- **No file editing**: Read-only analysis
- **Always verify MCP usage**: Check communication.md for MCP tool calls

## INTEGRATION WITH PARENT

```markdown
If score ≥ 80:
  → Launch Phase 3 (sitemap-executor || seo-orchestrator) in parallel

If score < 80 and retriesRemaining > 0:
  → Create agent-context-sitemap-analyst.md with issues from validation
  → Relaunch sitemap-analyst with feedback
  → Decrement retriesRemaining

If score < 80 and retriesRemaining = 0:
  → Escalate to user for manual sitemap editing
```

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
